### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Official Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#differentiating-nested-groups) - A love the Tailwind CSS docs. The hover and focus section has some great examples and use cases of dealing with nested and peer group styles. A lot of helpful guidance here to achieve a close match to the design comp.
- [A complete guide to the HTML number input](https://olliewilliams.xyz/blog/guide-to-html-number-input/) - Brilliant and comprehensive article for all things HTML number input. This was a big help in understanding the various attributes of the input and the differences between browsers, and how they handle the settings.
- [Remove spinners Tailwind CSS](https://dev.to/bobbyiliev/how-to-remove-arrow-on-input-type-number-with-tailwind-css-5b0f) - Another good, straightforward article on the necessary Tailwind classes and settings used for updating the default appearance of number inputs.
